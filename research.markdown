My research agenda seeks to leverage under-utilized data sources to study heterogeneous labor market outcomes to help inform optimal behavior for under-represented groups. In conducting my research, I strive to make my code and methods accessible via public availability and readability. Due to my use of various programming languages to estimate my models, I am able to provide a variety of directed undergraduate and graduate research experiences to match the different career goals of students. 

My current line of research focuses on workplace flexibility (i.e., flexible workplace policies such as work-from-home and the ability to define one's work schedule) and understanding the empirical fact that there is a positive relationship between wages and flexibility.
