title: "Teaching Job Market Advice"

While participating in the 2022-23 economics job market in search of a teaching-focused position, I found that the internet was lacking resources for my job market search: small liberal arts colleges and teaching (clinical) positions at larger universities. On this page, I hope to provide some job market advice and link to my documents with the goal of helping other individuals on the teaching market. While the information on this page reflects upon my own experience, I believe I had a successful market with 59 applications, 24 interview requests (18 completed), 9 flyout requests (5 completed), and 4 offers. 

## Cover Letters 

For many teaching positions, the cover letter is the first document read by a search committee; they want to know that you actually *want* a teaching-focused position (as opposed to viewing their position as a "back-up") or that you actually want to be at that college. 

I wrote my cover letter with the intent of providing highlights from the other application documents, as if the search committee were to make a decision having only read my cover letter.
I had a template cover letter for small liberal arts colleges and one for teaching positions at large public universities. Both templates included my enthusiasm for the position/school and the three key points of my teaching statement. The key difference is that the small liberal arts college cover letter included information on how I could include undergraduate students in my research, while the large university cover letter discussed how I would apply my experience as a TA for large classes to my own large courses.

## Teaching Statement 



## Research Statement 

For a small liberal arts college, a professorship position requires research along two dimension: scholarly work (publications) and creating opportunities for students. For many small liberal arts college, the position expects encouragement and mentorship of student research experiences, either independently or as an undergraduate research assistant. In addition to discussing my research, I highlight opportunities to include undergraduate students in my research process and teach them relevant skills for various career paths post-graduation.

## Job Market Timing 


##  Interviews

For each interview, I dedicated a page in my job market notebook with the general information about the posting and pre-written questions that I wanted answers to with space for those answers (see below for some of the questions I asked). The notebook provided a centralized location for the information that interviewers gave me as well as my impressions of the interview. (These information sheets became especially useful for reference if I was asked to do a flyout.) 

A useful piece of advice I received during the process was to not ask questions easily answerable by the website and/or posting. Before each interview, I would take notes about the posting, explore the departmental website, and check out your interviewers’ webpages. 
Some things to look for: 
- Is there a single introductory course or is it broken up into micro and macro?
- What clubs and/or societies exist for economics students? (Prepare to answer how you could provide support to these clubs and/or provide a service to the department by sponsoring something new)
- Are your interviewers in the same field as you? Are they tenure-track or teaching professors? 

This should go without saying, but **smile in your interviews** and be excited about your interaction with your interviewers! As my advisor told me, the search committee is looking for a colleague: someone with whom they can collaborate and would enjoy hanging out with at departmental events. While interviews can seem daunting, especially for jobs you’re really interested in, be sure to smile and be relaxed! And if anything goes wrong (faulty internet, cat walks across your desk, noisy lawn-care or neighbors), quickly acknowledge it and move on.


### Interview questions I was asked

#### General Teaching
1. Of the courses listed as necessary in the job posting, what do you want to teach and what would you not want to teach? *(Note: it is okay to not want to teach a course! However, if it’s a posting for a macroeconomist and you state that you never want to teach intermediate macro, the interview will not go well!)*
2. What are courses on and not on the course catalog that you would want to teach?
3. How do you structure my classes on a day-to-day basis? What do you require in your class?
4. What are some pedagogical techniques you have tried, and some that you want to try?
5. This school attracts students of all abilities - how would you ensure that you reach everyone?
6. What books (other than textbooks) would you want students to read to enrich courses?
7. Which economists do you want students to know about?
8. What do you want students to remember 5-10 years later after your course?
9. What is your ability to move to (insert town here)?
10. What is your ability to finish the PhD this year?

I almost received a question about how I would contribute to service, but it was forestalled by the listed service on my materials.

#### By Small Liberal Arts Colleges
1. Why did you apply for this position at this school? *(This was asked in at least four different interviews!)*
2. How do you plan to balance scholarly work/professional productivity and teaching excellence?
3. In 5 minutes, how would you explain my job market paper to undeclared students?
4. Which influential economists have impacted your research?
5. What paper are you envious of (i.e., what do you wish you had thought of and/or written first)?

#### By Large Universities
1. Why are you interested in teaching at a large school?
2. What is your willingness to teach pre-developed asynchronous courses?

### Questions I asked in interviews
#### To Everyone

1. How would you describe the economics students at your school? How does this differ from the general population of students? What traits/qualities do they share?
2. What is the collaboration like in the department regarding teaching similar classes? Is there a shared syllabus in the introductory/intermediate courses?
3. What is the ideal timing of second interviews and making offers? *(Note: most schools provided this without asking, but it is definitely worth asking if they don’t!)*
   
#### To Small Liberal Arts Colleges

1. How do students find out about this school? What makes them choose this school?
2. What role does economics play in the general education requirements?
3. What is the tenure timeline and requirements?
4. What mentoring and support do you provide for faculty on the tenure track?

#### To Large Universities

1. Why do students take (introductory/intermediate) economics classes?
2. What resources are there for me as an instructor (i.e., undergraduate learning assistants, graduate assistants)?
3. How do you measure teaching excellence?
